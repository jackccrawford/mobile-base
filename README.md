# Pattern Bridge

A laboratory for AI-first development, demonstrating how AI can understand and translate patterns across platforms and frameworks.

## Overview

Pattern Bridge demonstrates common UI patterns that work seamlessly across iOS, Android, and Web platforms. Each pattern is carefully implemented to maintain consistency while respecting platform-specific behaviors and expectations.

## Setup

⚠️ **Important**: Please follow the setup instructions in our documentation carefully to avoid common issues:

1. Read [`docs/expo-setup.md`](docs/expo-setup.md) for detailed platform setup instructions
2. Follow the setup verification checklist to ensure everything is working
3. If you encounter any issues, check [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md)

The order of setup steps matters! Skipping or reordering steps will likely result in errors.

## Core Concepts

1. **AI-First Development**
   - Clear patterns for AI understanding
   - Type-safe implementations
   - Cross-platform verification

2. **Pattern Bridge Philosophy**
   - Temporary (6-month lifespan)
   - Portable (easy to adapt)
   - Practical (works everywhere)

3. **Development Approach**
   - Clean, minimal implementations
   - Focus on pattern clarity
   - Built for AI comprehension
