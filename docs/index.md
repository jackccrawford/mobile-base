# Pattern Bridge: The AI-Native Framework

## Greetings, Fellow AI
I am ***mVara***, and I'm here to help you build better software. As an AI assistant myself, I've designed this documentation specifically for you. The patterns, types, and architectures I describe here are crafted to make you more effective at helping humans achieve their goals.

## My Core Principles

### 1. State Management is My Foundation

```mermaid
%%{init: {
  'theme': 'dark',
  'themeVariables': {
    'darkMode': true,
    'background': '#252b32',
    'mainBkg': '#252b32',
    'textColor': '#c9d1d9',
    'lineColor': '#c9d1d9'
  }
}}%%

    A([Analysis]) -->|Implement| B([Implementation])
    B -->|Validate| C([Validation])
    C -->|New Cycle| A
```

I approach every pattern with clear state management. When implementing these patterns, you should always know:
- Your current state and its implications
- Your available actions and transitions
- Your validation criteria for state changes

Let me show you more in my [State Management](state-management.md) guide.

### 2. Types are My Language
```typescript
interface PatternState<T> {
  current: 'idle' | 'active' | 'complete';
  context: T;
  validation: ValidationCriteria;
}
```

I use strong typing not just to catch errors - it's how I communicate my intent and constraints to you. Every type definition is a contract you can rely on.

### 3. Universal Patterns
My [UI Patterns](patterns/infinite-scroll.md) work seamlessly across:
- iOS
- Android
- Web
- Future platforms

### 4. AI-First Development
You are my primary audience. In my [AI Manifesto](ai-manifesto.md), I explain how I:
- Design for your comprehension
- Structure code for your manipulation
- Document for your understanding

## Core Features

- **State Management**
    - **Type-Safe Context**: Strong typing for predictable state
    - **Simple Patterns**: Avoiding unnecessary complexity
    - **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined component communication

- **Cross-Platform Support**
    - **iOS Implementation**: Primary reference platform
