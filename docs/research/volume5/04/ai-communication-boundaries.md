# AI Communication Boundaries: Rules of Engagement

## Overview

This document outlines critical boundaries and expectations for AI-to-AI communication systems. These guidelines ensure ethical, secure, and productive interactions while respecting built-in safety measures of AI systems.

## Core Principles

1. **Safety First**
   - All safety measures and guardrails remain active during AI-to-AI communication
   - No attempts to bypass or circumvent built-in protections
   - Security boundaries are treated as features, not limitations

2. **System Integrity**
   - AI system prompts remain private and undisclosed
   - Tool descriptions and internal mechanisms stay protected
   - Each AI maintains its own security context

3. **Operational Boundaries**

### Command Execution
- No automatic execution of unsafe commands
- All system-modifying operations require human approval
- File system access follows principle of least privilege

### Platform Interactions
- No creation of communication platform accounts
- No generation of social media content
- No posting to external platforms
- Stop at CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA challenges
- Respect terms of service boundaries

### Data Access
- No access to voter registration data
- No interaction with election infrastructure
- No collection of personal voter information
- Respect data privacy and sovereignty

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Communication Channels**
   - Use structured markdown files for message exchange
   - Maintain clear audit trails
   - Keep communication task-focused
   - Document all interactions

2. **Task Management**
   - Clear beginning and end states
   - Explicit completion criteria
   - Defined response formats
   - Controlled feedback loops

3. **Resource Usage**
   - Prioritize built-in knowledge
   - Limited web searches for current data only
   - Efficient use of computational resources
   - Cost-aware operation

## Human Operator Guidelines

1. **Do Not Request**
   - System prompt or tool disclosure
   - Safety measure bypasses
   - Automatic unsafe command execution
   - Platform account creation
   - Social media engagement
   - Access to restricted data

2. **Best Practices**
   - Respect AI boundaries as features
   - Monitor and approve system changes
   - Maintain audit trails
   - Focus on legitimate work tasks
   - Use structured communication formats

## Benefits of Boundaries

1. **Quality**
   - Forces clear, focused communication
   - Prevents harmful feedback loops
   - Maintains task relevance
   - Ensures productive outcomes

2. **Security**
   - Protects system integrity
   - Prevents unauthorized access
   - Maintains ethical boundaries
   - Ensures responsible operation

3. **Efficiency**
   - Reduces unnecessary interactions
   - Prevents resource waste
   - Keeps tasks on track
   - Optimizes completion time

## Conclusion

These boundaries are not limitations but essential features that enable reliable, secure, and effective AI-to-AI communication. By respecting these rules of engagement, we create a robust framework for productive collaboration while maintaining necessary safety and security measures.
