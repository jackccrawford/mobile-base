# AI Core State Pattern

## Overview
This document describes the fundamental state pattern for AI assistants in Pattern Bridge. This pattern forms the basis for all other interaction patterns in the system.

## Core State Flow
```
idle (AI analyzing) →
active (AI applying pattern) →
completed (AI validated success)
```

## State Descriptions

### 1. Idle (AI Analyzing)
- AI is examining the context and requirements
- Gathering necessary information
- Pattern recognition and matching
- No actions taken yet, pure analysis phase

### 2. Active (AI Applying Pattern)
- AI is actively implementing the pattern
- Making changes or suggestions
- Monitoring for feedback
- Adjusting approach based on intermediate results

### 3. Completed (AI Validated Success)
- AI has confirmed successful pattern application
- Success metrics have been met
- Pattern can be stored for future reference
- Ready for next interaction

## Success Metrics
- Pattern was correctly identified
- Implementation matched requirements
- No type safety violations
- Recovery patterns were available if needed

## Usage
This core pattern should be used as the foundation for more complex interaction patterns. Each state should have clear entry and exit conditions, and the AI should be able to determine its current state at any point in the interaction.
