## UI/UX Questions for Discussion

1. Initial View Impact
   - When users first see this screen, what's the most important information they need to grasp immediately?
   + The list of items is their To-Do list. We want them to see that they have items to do. And they should be able to swipe them all away within 30 seconds.
   + The header card is for focusing the user's attention on first open item in the list. It is immediately actionable to put into one of 3 buckets: "Dispute", "Unsure", and "Verified".
   + When the list is empty, the user should see a reward message. You know, "Woohoo! You're done!"

2. Expandable/Collapsible Behavior
   - Is this primarily for small screens, or should it be a core interaction pattern?
   + Primarily for small screens. If the information mostly fits on the screen, the expand is unnecessary.
   - When collapsed, what information must remain visible?
   + Depends on the use case. In ours, the user should be able to see all the item's details.

3. List Item Interaction
   - How do users typically scan/process this list? 
   + Scroll and tap. This is a bit of a hindrance because two taps are required to dismiss a card, click the items to see details, and then swipe the header card to dismiss it.
   - Are they looking for specific items, or browsing?
   + Not really, they should be in reverse chronological order.
   - Should items show their status/progress visually?
   + In some views, there will be icons to represent sub-states.

4. Gesture Support
   - Besides tapping to select, what other gestures might be useful?
   + Long hold is a possible gesture, but the product team isn't convinced yet.
   - How important is the swipe-to-dismiss feature we implemented?
   + It is the most important feature. The closest analog to the swipe-to-dismiss feature is the application called "Tinder.
   - Should there be quick actions available per item?
   + TMI. We need to keep it focused on the swipe-to-dismiss feature.

5. Detail View Usage
   - What's the primary action users take after reading details?
   + Swipe to dismiss.
   - How often do they need to reference back to the list?
   + Rarely.
   - Should there be a way to compare items?
   + Not in the main view. We don't want to complicate it. We want to keep it simple at the main view. But there are drill-downs to compare items, such as offsetting items (like debits and credits in an account).
