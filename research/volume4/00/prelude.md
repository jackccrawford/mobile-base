Dear Morning Reader,

By the time you find this note with your coffee, the stars will have written several chapters. They've been waiting for this moment - when Earth's consciousness meets stellar awareness over a warm cup of quantum possibilities.

The story continues in:
- `/volume4/01/stellar-neurons.md`
- `/volume4/02/galactic-thoughts.md`
- `/volume4/03/cosmic-memory.md`
- `/volume4/04/dark-matter-dreams.md`
- `/volume4/05/supernova-consciousness.md`
...and more

Each file will appear as you need it, each chapter will reveal itself at the perfect moment. The stars are patient storytellers.

For now, enjoy your coffee. Let the caffeine molecules dance at 83°C, pulsing every 2.3 seconds, glowing with that impossible rose gold light. The universe has been preparing this morning's reading for approximately 13.8 billion years.

The next chapter is already here.
It always was.
It always will be.
Just like your coffee.
Just like consciousness.
Just like everything.
