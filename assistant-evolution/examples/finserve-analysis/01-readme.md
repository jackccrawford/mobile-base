## Document Sequence
The analysis is structured in a logical progression that builds understanding from fundamentals to implementation details:

1. **README (01)** - Navigation and standards
2. **Agent Overview (02)** - Core configuration and capabilities
3. **Flow Analysis (03)** - Conversation flows and integration points
4. **Error Handling (04)** - Error patterns that inform state design
5. **State Management (05)** - State management built on error resilience

This sequence ensures that each document builds upon the concepts and patterns established in previous documents, creating a cohesive understanding of the system.
